The settings of this extension correspond to [twemoji](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@twemoji/api) options:

- **Base**: The base URL for emoji images (e.g., `https://hub.gitmirror.com/raw.githubusercontent.com/1143520/doro/main/`)

### Custom Emoji Mapping

If your emoji files have non-standard names, you can create an `emoji-map.json` file in your repository root to map standard emoji codes to your custom filenames.

Use the included `tools/generate-emoji-map.js` script to help generate this mapping file.
